<h2>The Wolf and the Lamb</h2>

<div class="main-content">
<div class="text-content">
  <p>Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside,
when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to
drink a little lower down.  "There's my supper," thought he, "if
only I can find some excuse to seize it."  Then he called out to
the Lamb, "How dare you muddle the water from which I am
drinking?"</p>
<p>"Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up
there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to
me."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names
this time last year?"</p>
<p>"That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."</p></p>
<p>"I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was
your father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb
and

 .ate her all up.  But before she died she gasped out
 ."Any excuse will serve a tyrant."</p>

  <p class="fable-moral">Much wants more and loses all.</p>

  <h2>The Dog and the Shadow</h2>

<div class="text-content">
  <p>It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was
carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way
home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.  As he
crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the
water beneath.  Thinking it was another dog with another piece of
meat, he made up his mind to have that also.  So he made a snap at
the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of
meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.</p>

  <p class="fable-moral">Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</p>

  <h2>The Lion's Share</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
  <p>The Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal,
and the Wolf.  They hunted and they hunted till at last they
surprised a Stag, and soon took its life.  Then came the question
how the spoil should be divided.  "Quarter me this Stag," roared
the Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four
parts.  Then the Lion took his stand in front of the carcass and
pronounced judgment:  The first quarter is for me in my capacity
as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another share
comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth
quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will
dare to lay a paw upon it."</p>

  <p class="fable-moral">"Humph," grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail
  between his legs; but he spoke in a low growl
   ."You may share the labours of the great,
  but you will not share the spoil."</p>
